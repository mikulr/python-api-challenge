Several things were confirmed by the data

1. The closer to the equator, the higher the max temperature is. This is true in both hemispheres but the difference is much more dramatic in the northern hemisphere. (Likely owing to the fact that it is winter in this hemisphere as data was collected.)

2. Wind speed and cloudiness do not appear to be affected by relationship to the equator as both are fairly evenly distributeds.

3. Humidity in the nortern hemisphere increases as it moves away from the equator on the sample day and is more consisitent and on average higher in the southern hemisphere.
